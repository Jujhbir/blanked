Blanked is a project developed by Jujhbir Singh.

The aim of this project is to take the destractions out of studying all together.

As a struggling student, I needed a way to take the distractions out of studying altogether.

I have concluded that the biggest way students get disctracted is by getting distracted.

More specifically, students like me go to search for lets say music,

but because of advertisements and modern day distractions, you end up scrolling on youtube.

So I decided to add everything a student may need in one page. Available anywhere everywhere.

You can even add your own items if needed.

Yeah Thats It.
